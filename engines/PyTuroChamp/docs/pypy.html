<h3 id="improving-performance-by-using-pypy">Improving performance by using PyPy</h3>
<p>Running the scripts with <a href="http://pypy.org/">PyPy3</a> instead of python3 will make the engines run about two or three times as fast, so it is generally recommended to use PyPy.</p>
<p>Below is a sample terminal session that shows how to set up PyPy under <strong>Arch Linux</strong> and run the PyTuroChamp scripts.</p>
<p>Note that the “–local” command line switch is used here to install pip and python-chess into .local/ in the user’s home directory. This is optional, but perhaps a good idea on Linux. It also means that root permissions are not necessary during installation.</p>
<pre><code># Install the Python 3 version of PyPy;
#  this command works only on Arch
#  and might be different on your Linux distro:
$ sudo pacman -S pypy3

# Install the pip package manager for PyPy:
$ pypy3 -m ensurepip --user

# Install python-chess:
$ pypy3 -m pip install chess --user

# Show packages installed under PyPy,
#  chess should be there now:
$ pypy3 -m pip list --user
Package      Version
------------ -------
pip          20.2.4
chess        1.2.2
setuptools   50.3.2</code></pre>
